javafx.scene.Node is the base class for all Scene graph nodes. 
Then the javafx.scene.control.Control is the base class for scene graph nodes that the user can interact with. 
Implying the first that can be nodes in the scene that aren user interface nodes (there's 2 types of those).

NOTE : every JavaFX control provides a default implementation of this interface (Skinnable) but if we'd wanted to, 
we could subclass a control and override the methods in this interface or we could even create a custom control
that implements this interface. 

NOTE: Radio buttons in order to get them to work as expected, as they usually do, 
we need to add them to a toggle group. The toggle group class doens't descend 
from Node therefore it can't be added to a scene graph as such. So we need to find 
the fx define in hte fxml to use this toggle group. In general we use "fx define"  
when we have to add something in the fxml that isn't part of the scene graph. 
When we're refering to a fx ide value we put a $sign in front of it. 

JavaFX allows a third state to checkBokx (other than on/off) but we have to enable it, 
because is disabled by default. The states name is undetermined, 
implying that when enabled the checkBox will initially contain a dash.
